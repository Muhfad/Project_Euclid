STEPS

1 . generate a matrix with two columns and 1000 rows (The columns of M are X and Y )
2. Calculate distances between every pair. ( there are 1000*999/2 unique pairs)
 so for each pair find the distance between it and all the other pairs except itself.
3. find the time taken for this to run
4. use dot-product method for distances
5. use the dist function in R
5. Compare the times
6. Now use the Rcpp library to test fastdist2.cpp
7. Also use the the C++ function in eucdist.cpp
7. Test the speed of both approach
8. Check the code for fastdist2 it assumes that input is an integer change the type to double or float
9. Try all of this in python
