# Project Euclid
Time profiling for calculating Euclidean Distances for large Matrices
This is done using function written in R compared to functions written in C/C++ and call in R.
The same is done in python. The result is summarized in the jupyter notebook R_document. The code for the Pythone part of the project and the R part are separated.
